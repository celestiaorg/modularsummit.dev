But as computation is sharded across different rollups, the interoperability of applications running on these rollups becomes fragmented, significantly impacting user utility. Moreover, today rollups are operated by centralized servers that decide on which transactions to include and in what order. Fragmented interoperability and sequencing centralization are some of the biggest challenges facing rollups today as they undermine the core value-propositions of Ethereum. Shared decentralized (dumb) sequencing layers have the potential to improve the overall decentralization and interoperability of Ethereum’s rollup-centric future, but also create critical challenges that require creative solutions.",theme:"shared-seq",renderLabel:!1},{title:"Astria: Speedrunning the Endgame",date:"2023.

So far, this has started to include ERC-4337 bundling with its aggregate signature feature, but in the future such aggregation will include proofs of L2 state, a single recursive SNARK replacing many application-layer SNARKs, and perhaps even state update proof bundling across different L2s. This will add more load to the builder ecosystem.
